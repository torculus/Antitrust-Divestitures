# Antitrust Divestitures

This repository contains code for replicating my Masters Essay (Empirical Assessment of Partial Antitrust Divestitures). Code for the estimation is inspired by Miller and Weinberg's [Econometrica paper](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2017/11/01/understanding-price-effects-millercoors-joint-venture) and Chris Conlon's [Matlab© repository](https://github.com/chrisconlon/blp-demand)

Data Envelopment Analysis is estimated using the [DEAMATLAB](https://github.com/javierbarbero/DEAMATLAB) toolbox. You can find this from the "Add-Ons" menu in MATLAB©
